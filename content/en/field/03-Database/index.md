A database is generally a structured collection of information or data stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are typically controlled by Database Management Systems (DBMS). Together, the data, DBMS, and associated applications form a database system, often referred to simply as a database.

Today, data within the most common types of databases is typically modeled as a series of tables with rows and columns, which enables efficient processing and querying of data. This structure allows for easy access, management, modification, updating, control, and organization of the data. Most databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

Databases generally require comprehensive database software programs known as Database Management Systems (DBMS). A DBMS acts as an interface between the database and the end user or program, allowing users to search, update, and manage information in an organized and optimized manner. The DBMS also facilitates supervision and control of the database, enabling various management tasks such as performance monitoring, tuning, backup, and recovery.

Widely used database software or DBMS includes MySQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, FileMaker Pro, Oracle Database, and dBASE.
