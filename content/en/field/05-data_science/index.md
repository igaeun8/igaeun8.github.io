Data science is the scientific study of data to gain knowledge. This field combines multiple disciplines to extract information from large data sets, enabling rational decision-making and predictions. Data scientists, data analysts, data designers, data engineers, statisticians, database administrators, and business analysts all work within the realm of data science.

As the volume of data increases exponentially and businesses become more reliant on analytics to generate revenue and drive innovation, the demand for data science is rapidly growing. For example, as business interactions become digital, more data is generated, providing new opportunities to personalize environments, enhance services and customer satisfaction, develop new and improved products, and gain insights into increasing sales. Additionally, data science can help address some of the world's most challenging problems in various environments, including the business world.
