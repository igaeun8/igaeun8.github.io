Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field of study that investigates the interactions between humans and computers. This area often involves collaborative research among different disciplines such as computer science, psychology, and industrial engineering. The interaction referred to here manifests in the user interface between the user and the computer, which encompasses both hardware and software. Recently, the emergence of context-aware computing has expanded the definition of user interfaces to include surrounding contexts, gradually making its meaning more ambiguous.

The long-term goal of human-computer interaction is to maximize the potential of computers as tools, allowing for greater freedom of human will, enhancing creativity, and promoting communication and collaboration among humans. HCI professionals are typically designers interested in applying techniques developed in the field of human-computer interaction to real-world problems. In many cases, their work involves designing graphical user interfaces or web interfaces. HCI researchers often focus on developing new design techniques, testing new hardware, implementing new software systems, discovering new paradigms, or developing models and theories.
