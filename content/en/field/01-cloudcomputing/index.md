Cloud computing is a computing technology that provides remote computing resources and services via the internet.

The cloud computing service model is based on the concept of sharing on-demand computing resources, software, and information over the internet. Companies or individuals pay to access a virtual pool of shared resources, including computing, storage, and networking services located on remote servers owned and managed by service providers.

One of the advantages of cloud computing is that you only pay for what you use. This allows organizations to scale more quickly and efficiently without the need to purchase and maintain their own physical data centers and servers.

In simple terms, cloud computing connects users to a cloud platform using a network (mostly the internet) and allows them to request and access rented computing services. Central servers handle all communication between client devices and servers, facilitating data exchange. Security and privacy features are common components designed to keep this information secure.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution when adopting cloud computing architecture. What works effectively for one company may not fit anotherâ€™s business needs. In fact, this flexibility and multifunctionality is one of the hallmark features of the cloud, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing markets or metrics.

There are three cloud computing deployment models: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.
