Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the scientific field focused on building computers and machines that can infer, learn, and act in ways that require human intelligence or exceed the analytical capabilities of humans, typically involving large-scale data.

AI encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including computer engineering, data analysis and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, as well as philosophy and psychology.

At the operational level of business, AI primarily refers to technologies based on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analysis, predictions and forecasts, object classification, natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.

While the specifics of each AI technology may vary, the core principle revolves around data. AI systems learn from and improve through vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans might overlook.

This learning process often involves rules or guiding algorithms that steer AI's analysis and decision-making. In the widely used subset of AI known as machine learning, algorithms learn from labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or classify information.

An additional specialization, deep learning, utilizes artificial neural networks composed of multiple layers that mimic the structure and function of the human brain to process information. AI systems are becoming increasingly adept at performing specific tasks, from image recognition to language translation, through continuous learning and adaptation.
