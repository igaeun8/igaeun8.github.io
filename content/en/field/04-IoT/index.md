The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the technology that connects various objects to the internet by embedding sensors and communication functions into them. In other words, it means connecting various objects through wireless communication. The term "objects" encompasses a wide range of items, including home appliances, mobile devices, and wearable devices.

A typical IoT system operates through real-time data collection and exchange. There are three main components of an IoT system:

First, there are smart devices. These are devices endowed with computing functions, such as televisions, security cameras, or fitness equipment. They collect data from the environment, user inputs, or usage patterns and exchange data with IoT applications over the internet.

Second, there are IoT applications. IoT applications are a collection of services and software that integrate data received from various IoT devices. They use machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to analyze this data and make informed decisions. These decisions are then communicated back to the IoT devices, which respond intelligently to the inputs.

Third, there is a graphical user interface. The graphical user interface allows for the management of IoT devices or fleets of devices. A common example would be a mobile application or website that can be used to register and control smart devices.
