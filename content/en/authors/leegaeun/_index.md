Hello. I am Lee Gaeun, a student in the Department of Computer Artificial Intelligence. I used to enjoy expressing and creating things, which led me to study art for college entrance exams. Due to personal reasons, I had to stop pursuing art, but I became interested in coding, which shares a similar creative appeal. This sparked my interest in front-end development, where I can incorporate design elements. Through various experiences, I aim to improve my skills and abilities to become a front-end developer capable of providing a convenient UX. Although I am currently a second-year undergraduate, I will continue to work hard to become a great developer.
