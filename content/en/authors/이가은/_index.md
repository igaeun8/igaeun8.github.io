Hello, I'm Lee Ga-eun, a computer artificial intelligence major. I like to express and create something, so I did art for entrance examinations. 
I quit the art of entrance examination due to personal reasons, but I became interested in coding with similar charms, 
I became interested in the front end where design elements could be used.
I want to be a front-end developer who can provide convenient UX by improving various skills and abilities through various experiences. 
 I'm still a second-year undergraduate, but I'll continue to work hard to become a great developer.
